# Description

These scripts can be run within a directory and they'll run all the code for you so you don't need to keep pressing "enter" for 30 years. However, the directories in these folders are specific to the one on my Fermilab account so they should be amended before using. To find out how they run, just type `./filename.sh -h` in the command line
