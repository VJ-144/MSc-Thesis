# Code used for the final thesis

This folder contains the code that was used to both analyse and plot the data for the MSc thesis. The folders are:

- Shell_Scripts - This contains scripts that run multiple programs at once (very useful if you want to get all the results at once) 
- Data_Analysis - This contains the program that analyses the GENIE data and makes plots
