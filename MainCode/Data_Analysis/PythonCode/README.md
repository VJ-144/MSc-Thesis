# This Jupyter Notebook File Produces More Sophisticated Graphs Than The ROOT Scripts

Due to my inexperience with C/C++ and ROOT, all of the heatmaps and bar graphs were created here. The way I made them was by running one of the event counting scripts (found in the Scripts folder) which printed the histogram bin contents onto the screen. I then copied them into a numpy array, which can be seen in the python code, and plotted the graphs with matplotlib. The graph outputs should be visible in the .ipynb file and also in my thesis.
